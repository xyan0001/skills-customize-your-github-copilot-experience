# Assignment Markdown Structure Guidelines

All assignment markdown files should follow these guidelines:

## 1. Template Usage

- Assignment markdown files must follow the structure in [`templates/assignment-template.md`](../../templates/assignment-template.md).
- The assignment must be created as a `README.md` file
- Do not remove or skip required sections from the template.

## 2. Section Guidance

The section headers should reflect the structure in the template, including the exact icon usage.

- **Title**: Replace `[Assignment Title]` with a short, descriptive name (e.g., `Python Basics`, `Loops and Conditionals`, `Functions and Modules`).
- **Objective**: Write 1-2 sentences summarizing what the student will learn or accomplish. Focus on the main skills or concepts.
- **Tasks**: For each task:
   - Use a specific, action-oriented task name
   - In the Description, clearly state what the student must do.
   - In Requirements, use bullet points to list the expected outcomes or features. Be specific and measurable
   - Provide example input/output in code blocks if helpful.

Do not include extra sections unless explicitly specified.
